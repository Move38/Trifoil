Setup

Arrange 6 blinks in a triangle formation.

Rules

The game ends when:

A player gets a chain of 5 pips (they win)  
A player runs out of pips (the longest chain wins)  
Either player fills a blink with 6 pips (the longest chain wins)  

On your turn you can do any of the following twice:

Place one pip anywhere on the board except on the outside edges  
Rotate the 3-blink triangle on the corner of the board. You can only rotate a triangle if you have less pips on the corner than your opponent.  
Use one of your pips to push outwards from the center of the blink, displacing any pips in its path in a straight line. You cannot do this if it will result in a pip being pushed off the board.  

Miscellaneous rules:

A single blink can contribute at most 2 pips to a chain.  
During the first turn of the game, the player can only move once instead of twice.
